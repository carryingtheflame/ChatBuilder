## Development Notes

### Privacy and Security
Security and privacy are paramount to chat services, and this codebase was designed to support privacy and security goals in a few ways.

First, this code runs entirely on the user's computer, in their Web browser. This ensures there are no marginal risks associated with sending data over the Internet.

Second, this code does not rely on external libraries--they are not linked or copied in. This eliminates risks associated with external libraries which send private data to advertising agencies such as Facebook ([true story](https://www.statnews.com/2023/06/13/suicide-hotlines-988-data-privacy-facebook/)).
