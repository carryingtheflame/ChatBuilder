## Troubleshooting

### Cut Text Too Soon
No worries, the text is probably still on your clipboard. Simply paste it using one of these options:
1. Option 1
    1. Click the composition field.
    2. Click "Edit" from the top of your browser window.
    3. Click "Paste."
2. Option 2
    1. Right click the composition field.
    2. Click "Paste."
3. Option 3
    1. Windows or Linux: Hold down the Control key.
    2. Mac: Hold down the Command key.
    3. Press the V key.

### Button Emoticon Not Displaying Correctly
If the scissors button label (✂️) is showing up as odd characters instead of as an emoticon, change the character set of your browser to UTF-8:

- Firefox
    1. Click "View" from the top of your browser window.
    2. Click "Text Encoding."
    3. Click "Unicode (UTF-8)" from the dropdown menu.
- Safari
    1. Click "View" from the top of your browser window.
    2. Click "Text Encoding."
    3. Click "Unicode (UTF-8)" from the dropdown menu.
- Internet Explorer
    1. Navigate to the page you're having trouble viewing.
    2. Right-click on the page.
    3. Mouse over "Encoding."
    4. In the expanded menu, click "Unicode (UTF-8)."

Chrome and Edge do not allow the user to change the character encoding. This app was developed for Chrome, so if you are having this problem with Chrome, please write to me and let me know.

### Privacy and Security
Security and privacy are paramount to chat services, and this codebase was designed to support privacy and security goals in a few ways.

First, this code runs entirely on the user's computer, in their Web browser. This ensures there are no marginal risks associated with sending data over the Internet.

Second, this code does not rely on external libraries--they are not linked or copied in. This eliminates risks associated with external libraries which send private data to advertising agencies such as Facebook ([true story](https://www.statnews.com/2023/06/13/suicide-hotlines-988-data-privacy-facebook/)).
