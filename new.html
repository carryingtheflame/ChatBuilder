<div class="copyables">Is there something that you feel is more important for us to talk about right now?</div><br/>
<div class="copyables">It sounds like it's hard to think about what you can do to stay safe. I want you to know that I care about you and your safety, and I'm glad you reached out today.

<h4>Affirming</h4>
<div class="copyables">In spite of everything going on right now, your reaching out and talking with me is a step you have taken to address your safety.

<h4>Probing Needs</h4>
<div class="copyables">While our focus is on helping folks remain safe during a crisis, I hear that safety is not a topic you are interested in talking about right now.  Maybe you can tell me more about why you reached out tonight, so that I can better support you during this conversation?</div><br/>

<h4>Backing Up To Gathering Information</h4>
<div class="copyables">It sounds like thinking of ways to stay safe feels like too much right now. I'd like to hear more about what's been going on for you. What thoughts were going through your head as you reached out to us today?</div><br/>
