 Structures chat service work.


## Installation
1. Click the green button labeled Code up top, then click "Download ZIP."
2. Unzip the folder.
3. Open Chat Builder.html in Google Chrome.


## How to Use
1. Click the appropriate conversation stage.
2. To add blue or green text to the composition field at the bottom, click on that text.
3. Edit the composition field as desired.
4. To cut your composed text, either:
    1. Click the scissors button (✂️) or 
    2. Press the Enter key.
5. Paste the text into your chat app.


## Troubleshooting

### Cut Text Too Soon
No worries, the text is probably still on your clipboard. Simply paste it using one of these options:
1. Click in the compositin field and click Edit > Paste.
1. Right click the composition field and click Paste.
3. Hold down the Control key (Windows and Linux) or Command key (Mac) and then tap the V key.

### Button Label Not Displaying Correctly
If the scissors button label (✂️) is showing up as odd characters instead of as an emoticon, change the character set of your browser to UTF-8.

## Development Notes

### Privacy and Security
Security and privacy are paramount to chat services, and this codebase was designed to support privacy and security goals in a few ways.

First, this code runs entirely on the user's computer, in their Web browser. This ensures there are no marginal risks associated with sending data over the Internet.

Second, this code does not rely on external libraries--they are not linked or copied in. This eliminates risks associated with external libraries which send private data to advertising agencies such as Facebook ([true story](https://www.statnews.com/2023/06/13/suicide-hotlines-988-data-privacy-facebook/)).
